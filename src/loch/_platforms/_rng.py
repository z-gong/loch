    Host-side random number generator for both CUDA and OpenCL backends.

    This class generates random numbers on the host (CPU) that are then
    transferred to the GPU for use in kernels. This approach eliminates
    the need for device-side RNG libraries (like CURAND) and simplifies
    cross-platform support.

    Random number batches are pre-computed in a background thread while GPU
    kernels are running, so that they are ready when the next batch is requested.
